Deep Supervised Hashing with Triplet Labels 
===================

This repository contains the code for the deep hashing approach proposed in our paper: 

["Deep Supervised Hashing with Triplet Labels".](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03900) Xiaofang Wang, Yi Shi and Kris M. Kitani. ACCV 2016.

Part of the code is modified from [here](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj/code/DPSH.zip).

## Overview ##
We provide an example to run our method on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Our proposed deep hashing method can generate low-dimensional binary codes for images, which can later be used for large-scale image search. Details about the approach can be found in our paper ["Deep Supervised Hashing with Triplet Labels"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03900).

## Requirements ##
This code is written in MATLAB and requires [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/).

## Preparation ##
- Download the CIFAR-10 dataset from [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-matlab.tar.gz). Uncompress the file and put the folder "cifar-10-batches-mat/" under the main folder.
- Download the Pretrained VGG-F model from [here](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-f.mat). Put the model under the main folder.

## Usage ##
Run the following command in MATLAB:
```
$ DTSH(24)
```

This will gives you the binary codes generated by our method, as well as the test performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Here 24 represents the traget code length and you may change it to other numbers.
